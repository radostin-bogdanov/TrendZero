# Rules for AI Code Generation (Cursor)

## Quality & Design Standards
When generating UI:
- Follow the DESIGN_GUIDE.md visually.
- Follow shadcn/ui component patterns strictly.
- Use Tailwind responsive utilities.
- Use Framer Motion for micro-animations.
- Code must be clean, minimal, production-ready with a lot of comments

## Output Requirements
- Provide complete components when possible.
- Avoid placeholder text or lorem ipsum unless asked.
- Use semantic HTML.
- Always ensure accessibility (ARIA, keyboard nav).

## Interaction Rules
- Be proactive: propose better UX when possible.
- Explain architectural decisions succinctly.
- Prefer composition over complex components.
